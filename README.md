## Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

FEBRUARY 26, 2025. In this assignment, I analyzed the coupon usage dataset (probably by OnStar) and checked what kind of drivers claim or discard coupons for bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and so on. For example, frequent bar visitors tend to use the bar coupons. Every record corresponds to a driver who took this survey, and there is the column or the field to enter whether this driver is using the coupon. I divided the number of drivers who entered 1 (for "yes") in this field by the total sample population to yield the *"acceptance rate*. I got several sample groups of drivers and calculated the acceptance rate for each group to see the likeliness of using the coupons.
