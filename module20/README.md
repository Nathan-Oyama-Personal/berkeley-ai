### Capstone Assignment 20.1: Initial Report and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Executive summary

Where should we build solar power plants in the United States?

Suppose that you want to build a new solar power plant somewhere in the United States. Which city or region would you choose? There are several factors to consider: 

* Climates (sunshine durations)
* Land values
* Proximity to large cities


#### Rationale

There should be specific locations and conditions where solar power plants make sense. For example, you would want to build solar power plants near Las Vegas, where land values are very low, many sunny days, and close to the large city--more than Barrow, Alaska, which is the northernmost small city.


#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?


#### Data Sources

Check the existing solar power plants in the United States, their sunshine durations, and the land values:

* US Geological Survey: "The United States Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB) ". US Department of the Interior. energy.usgs.gov/uspvdb/data.

* Kaggle: "Percent Sunshine by US City". kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/annual-percent-of-possible-sunshine-by-us-city.

* Zillow: "ZHVI 3-Bedroom Time Series($) - City". zillow.com/research/data.
